If you've watched any news in the last ten years, read any newspapers in the last fifteen (Some people still do!), or talked to that technically inclined cousin of yours, then you've probably heard three words that are specific to this field:

1. Hacker (or Hacking)
2. Code (or coding)
3. Programming (Or programs)

Lets talk about each one specifically since they're going to be so prevalent in the next ten years of your life should you decide to be a programmer. The first and most complicated word is *Hacker*. You've probably heard it in a very negative tone, often defined as a person who uses computers to illegally gain access to computers to hinder or damage. Hell, you've probably had some idiot claim to be a hacker in order to intimidate you into doing something.

**Guess what**: That's not what _hacker_ means. No, there's already a name for people who do what I just described: Criminals. They don't need a special name to help them appear more mysterious or dangerous. In reality, a hacker is a member of the hacker subculture and simply an individual who seeks to learn as much as possible using technology. Usually under a self-defined code of ethics, not necessarily ones that reflect common law. Many consider the only method of learning is to examine, since the information necessary for their own enlightenment is not free.‚Äè

The latter two terms are less culturally significant but should still be defined and talked about: _Programming_ is the act of writing code, using a programming language. A programming language is the language we, humans, use to instruct computers, dumb pieces of plastic, on what to do. A program (or script) is a list of instructions that you've laid out for the computer to follow and complete. Programs are sometimes called software, applications, or scripts depending on the complexity or detail involved in using them.

The act of programming is to write these scripts or applications in a programming language, like Ruby. A computer only knows how and when to do things if you tell it to in it's own language, Binary. 

### Binary's Count 1 To 10, Print Sum

<<(code/count-to-ten.binary)    

This program tells the computer to take every number from 1 to 10, add them together, and display the sum (55). It's complex, arcane, and completely unreadable to the naked eye for most people. Would you believe that people actually programmed applications this way? Simple software, like a calculator, required complex and time consuming work that was error prone and easily crashed. The same code is written here in Ruby:

### Ruby's Count 1 To 10, Print Sum
    
<script src="http://gist.github.com/654757.js?file=count-to-ten.rb"></script>

Or even:
<<(code/alt-count-to-ten.rb)

It's obvious in the previous two examples that programming languages are a tool for making developing easier. Programming in Ruby works by writing text (like above), having the Ruby interpretor compile it, and getting the result of your work. The next two examples are exactly the same, first in Java a really powerful and common language, the second in Ruby:

### Java's "Hello, World"

<<(code/hello-world.java)

### Ruby's "Hello, World"

<<(code/hello-word.rb)
    
Meanwhile, _Code_ is a language agnostic term for the source code that we write. Further, source code is is any collection of statements or declarations written in some human-readable computer programming language. The above examples I've listed are exactly that: Code.
